# Metabolite-signatures-of-chronological-age-aging-survival-and-longevity
This repository includes scripts of the analyses included in the manuscript

We include 2  Rmarkdown files per analysis:

1- metabolites associated with chronological age

           lipid analysis: Metabolite.batch4_age_assoc_no_EL_final.Rmd 
           
           polar metabolites analysis: Metabolite.batch5_age_assoc_no_EL_final.Rmd]

2- metabolites associated with extreme longevity 

          lipid analysis: Metabolite.batch4_EL_assoc_final.Rmd
          
          polar metabolites analysis: Metabolite.batch5_EL_assoc_final.Rmd
          
3- metabolites associated with mortality risk 

          lipid analysis: Metabolite.batch4_survival_final.Rmd
          
          polar metabolites analysis: Metabolite.batch5_survival_final.Rmd

4- metabolites associated with longitudinal changes
 
          lipid analysis: Metabolite.batch4_age_relative.change_gee.06.14.2024.Rmd
          
          polar metabolites analysis: Metabolite.batch5_age_relative.change_gee.06.14.2024.Rmd



In addition, we include the analysis that we conducted to generate the metabolomic clock

          Metabolomic_aging_clock.Rmd
