# Metabolite-signatures-of-chronological-age-aging-survival-and-longevity
This repository includes scripts of the analyses included in the manuscript

We include 2  Rmarkdown files per analysis:

1- metabolites associated with chronological age

           lipid analysis: Metabolite.batch4_age_assoc_no_EL_final.Rmd 
           
           polar metabolites analysis: Metabolite.batch5_age_assoc_no_EL_final.Rmd]

2- metabolites associated with extreme longevity [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]

3- metabolites associated with mortality risk [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]

4- metabolites associated with longitudinal changes  [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]


In additon, we include the aalysis that we conducted to generate the metabolomic clock.
