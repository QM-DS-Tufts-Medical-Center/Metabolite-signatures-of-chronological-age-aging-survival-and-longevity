# Metabolite-signatures-of-chronological-age-aging-survival-and-longevity
This repository includes scripts of the analyses included in the manuscript

We include 2 HTML files generated from Rmarkdown that describe the steps of the analysis to identify:

1- metabolites associated with chronological age [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]

2- metabolites associated with extreme longevity [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]

3- metabolites associated with mortality risk [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]

4- metabolites associated with longitudinal changes  [lipid and polar metabolites are in two separate analysis scripts]


In additon, we include the aalysis that we conducted to generate the metabolomic clock.
